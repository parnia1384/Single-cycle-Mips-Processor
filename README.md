# Single-cycle-Mips-Processor
A complete Verilog implementation of a single-cycle MIPS processor based on the Harris &amp; Harris "Digital Design and Computer Architecture" textbook. This educational project implements a 32-bit RISC processor that executes one instruction per clock cycle. The processor supports fundamental instruction types: R-type, and I-type.
